# Description
It is just a regular calculator. Nothing special lol.
# What can this calculator do?
It can calculate two or more rational numbers with basic operators like :
<ol>
  <li>+</li>
  <li>-</li>
  <li>ร</li>
  <li>รท</li>
</ol>
# Bugs/mistakes
There's still a mistake with the decimal. I will fix it.. later.. hehe<br>
Beside that, I'm still trying to make the numbers back to '0' when the operator is inputed<br>
